# Old-Jack-s-Texture-Pack
Minecraft: Programmer's Art compatibility pack with default textures by JackNotLantern

## Descrition
In 1.16 the default Minecraft textures were updated. The old textures are still available in "Programmer Art" resource pack, but when using it some new and old blocks textures contrast a lot.
This resource pack attempts to change textures of some of contrasting blocks to look like the old textures.

Except the old netherrack. I hate the old netherrack.

## Installation
1. Download Old.Jack.s.Texture.Pack.zip from releases.
2. Extract it into Minecraft resourcepacks folder (.minecraft\resourcepacks).

## Configuration
